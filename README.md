# Java Programming

Solved exercises from the Java Programming MOOC by University of Helsinki.

New problem sets are in 'mooc-java-programming-i' folder, where I push solutions as I make them. All other folders are solutions made before the creation of the repository.
In each problem set, solutions are inside 'src/main'.

You can find the entire course in [here](https://java-programming.mooc.fi/).
